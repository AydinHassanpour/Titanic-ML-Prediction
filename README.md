# Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a machine learning project that uses the popular Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on attributes like passenger class, age, gender etc.

## Overview

- Exploratory data analysis of Titanic dataset 
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Training machine learning models - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch
- Generating predictions on test data
- Creating submission file for Kaggle

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run this project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to install the following libraries:

- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

### Running the scripts

- Clone this repository to your local machine
- Get the Titanic dataset from Kaggle
- Run the Jupyter notebooks in sequential order
- Generate predictions and create submission file

## Results

The best Kaggle score obtained was 0.xx using the XGBoost model after hyperparameter tuning.
